git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## Subscription data safeguards

To verify the hardened `public.subscribers` policies locally, use the Supabase CLI test runner:

```sh
supabase db reset --linked
supabase db test --pattern subscribers_policies
```

The companion test in `supabase/tests/subscribers_policies.test.sql` runs through the following scenarios:

1. An authenticated member can only insert or update their row when the JWT `sub` and `email` claims match the payload being written.
2. Anonymous or mismatched members are denied when attempting to touch someone elseâ€™s row.
3. The Stripe sync edge function, which operates with `role = service_role`, can still upsert records for billing reconciliation.

For production observability, consider enabling [Postgres audit triggers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgaudit) or lightweight log-based alerts that watch for unexpected `UPDATE`/`INSERT` events on `public.subscribers`. Pairing those alerts with routine Supabase `db test` runs in CI will help surface policy regressions early.
